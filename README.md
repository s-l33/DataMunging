# Data Munging

Data Munging application finds the smallest temperature spread from the **weather.dat** file and the team's name with the smallest difference in 'for' and 'against' goals from the **football.dat** file. Files were attached to the Files folder in **DataMunging.Client** Console application

## Requiremnts

The coding exercise is called Data Munging. It is a three-part challenge. We kindly request that you please complete each part individually (without reading ahead). Have fun with the challenge, and don't overthink it.
 

### PART ONE: Weather Data

The attached weather.dat file shows daily weather data for Morristown, NJ, for June 2002. Save this text file, then write a program to output the day number (found in column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is in the second column, and the minimum temperature is in the third column).

*********** PLEASE DON'T READ AHEAD UNTIL YOU COMPLETE PART ONE ***********

### PART TWO: Soccer League Table

The attached file football.dat contains the English Premier League results for 2001/2. The columns' F' and 'A' contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents and 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the team's name with the smallest difference in 'for' and 'against' goals. 

*********** PLEASE DON'T READ AHEAD UNTIL YOU COMPLETE PART TWO ***********

### PART THREE: DRY Fusion

Take the two programs you previously completed and factor out as much common code as possible, leaving you with two smaller programs and some shared functionality.

## Tech

- [C#]
- [NET 7]
- [LINQ]


## Run

Select **DataMunging.Client** Console application as a Startup project and Run.
You should enter **w** to see the weather data results, and **f** for football data results.
